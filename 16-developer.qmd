## Implementation language

ELCOM is implemented in Fortran 90 (with F95 extensions) so that three-dimensional space can be mapped into a single vector for fast operation using array-processing techniques.

Only the computational cells that contain water are represented in the single vector so that memory usage is minimized. This allows Fortran 90 compiler parallelization and vectorization without platform-specific modification of the code. A future extension of ELCOM will include dynamic pressure effects to account for nonlinear dynamics of internal waves that may be lost due to the hydrostatic approximation.
